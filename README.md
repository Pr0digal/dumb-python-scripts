# 🐍 Silly Python Scripts

Welcome to the land of the absurd, unnecessary, and questionably useful Python code!  
This is a growing collection of **silly scripts** made for laughs, learning, or when coffee kicks in a little too hard.

## 🤹 What’s Inside?

Here you'll find Python scripts that:

- Generate passive-aggressive error messages 😤
- Rename your files with dad jokes 📁➡️🤣
- Simulate AI having an existential crisis 🤖
- And other chaotic-good behavior...

> Think of it as a digital junk drawer—but with slightly better syntax.

## 🧪 Why?

Because not everything has to be serious.  
These scripts are built to:
- Learn by doing (and laughing)
- Break things on purpose
- Impress your dog or mildly confuse your coworkers
